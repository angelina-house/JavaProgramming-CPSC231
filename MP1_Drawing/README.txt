In my drawing.java program I use a combination of loops, a 2d array and print statements to create
a drawing board with a heart "drawn" in the middle.

createCanvas Method
This method takes in two integers which represent the size of the canvas and returns a 2d array canvas.

addDrawing Method
This method takes in the canvas array, a character value, and an x and y value for placement.

printCanvas Method
This method takes in the canvas array and prints out the characters in the array.
